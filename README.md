## Usage

### EventBridge Bus

```hcl
module "eventbridge" {
  source = ""

  bus_name = "my-bus"

  tags = {
    Name = "my-bus"
  }
}
```

### EventBridge Rule 

```hcl
module "eventbridge" {
  source = ""

  bus_name = "my-bus"

  create_targets = false
  
  rules = {
    logs = {
      description   = "Capture log data"
      event_pattern = jsonencode({ "source" : ["my.app.logs"] })
    }
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "my-bus"
  }
}
```

### EventBridge Target

```hcl
module "eventbridge" {
  source = ""

  bus_name = "my-bus"
  
  rules = {
    logs = {
      description   = "Capture log data"
      event_pattern = jsonencode({ "source" : ["my.app.logs"] })
    }
  }
  
  targets = {
    logs = [
      {
        name = "send-logs-to-sqs"
        arn  = aws_sqs_queue.queue.arn
      },
      {
        name = "send-logs-to-cloudwatch"
        arn  = aws_cloudwatch_log_stream.logs.arn
      }
    ]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "my-bus"
  }
}
```

### EventBridge Archive

```hcl
module "eventbridge_with_archive" {
  source = ""

  bus_name = "my-bus"
  
  create_archives = true

  archive_config = [
    {
      name           = "my-bus-launch-archive",
      description    = "EC2 AutoScaling Event archive",
      retention_days = 1
      event_pattern  = <<PATTERN
      {
        "source": ["aws.autoscaling"],
        "detail-type": ["EC2 Instance Launch Successful"]
      }
      PATTERN
    }
  ]

  tags = {
    Name = "my-bus"
  }
}
```

### EventBridge Permission 

```hcl
module "eventbridge_with_permissions" {
  source = ""

  bus_name = "my-bus"

  create_permissions = true

  permission_config = [
    {
      account_id   = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID",
      statement_id = "development_account"
    }
  ]

  tags = {
    Name = "my-bus"
  }
}
```

## Additional IAM policies for Step Function

In addition to all supported AWS service integrations you may want to create and attach additional policies.

There are 5 supported ways to attach additional IAM policies to IAM role used by Step Function:

  1. `policy_json` - JSON string or heredoc, when `attach_policy_json = true`.
  2. `policy_jsons` - List of JSON strings or heredoc, when `attach_policy_jsons = true` and `number_of_policy_jsons > 0`.
  3. `policy` - ARN of existing IAM policy, when `attach_policy = true`.
  4. `policies` - List of ARNs of existing IAM policies, when `attach_policies = true` and `number_of_policies > 0`.
  5. `policy_statements` - Map of maps to define IAM statements which will be generated as IAM policy. Requires `attach_policy_statements = true`. See `examples/complete` for more information.

## Conditional creation

Sometimes you need to have a way to create resources conditionally but Terraform does not allow usage of `count` inside `module` block, so the solution is to specify `create` arguments.

```hcl
module "eventbridge" {
  source = ""

  create = false # to disable all resources

  create_bus         = false  # to control creation of the EventBridge Bus and related resources
  create_rule        = false  # to control creation of EventBridge Rules and related resources
  create_targets     = false  # to control creation of EventBridge Targets and related resources
  create_archives    = false  # to control creation of EventBridge Archives
  create_permissions = false  # to control creation of EventBridge Permissions
  create_role        = false  # to control creation of the IAM role and policies required for EventBridge

  attach_kinesis_policy          = false
  attach_kinesis_firehose_policy = false
  attach_sqs_policy              = false
  attach_ecs_policy              = false
  attach_lambda_policy           = false
  attach_sfn_policy              = false
  attach_cloudwatch_policy       = false
  attach_tracing_policy          = false

  # ... omitted
}
```
